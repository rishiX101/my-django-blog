My Django Blog Application

About:
This is a modern, full-featured blogging platform built using the Django framework.
It implements a complete data structure for posts, authors, tags, and comments, demonstrating core web development practices.
The application is configured to prioritize security by handling the secret key and local database file (db.sqlite3) outside of version control.

How to Use It:
1)Preparation: Before starting, ensure you have Python 3.x and the Git tool installed on your computer.

2)Get the Code: Download the project files onto your computer by cloning the repository from GitHub, and then move into the new project folder.

3)Setup and Install: Create a virtual environment to keep the project clean, activate it, and then install all the necessary software packages listed in the requirements.txt file.

4)Security and Database: Set your unique Django Secret Key as an environment variable in your terminal session, then run the migrations to build the database structure,
  and finally create an administrator user for accessing the blog and the admin panel.

5)Start the Application: Launch the local development server. You can then view the application in your web browser using the local address provided by the server.
